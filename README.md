## Updated on August 2024:

Refactored some of the code in order to challange myself by diving into legacy project.
Main focus was on making the worst parts of the code work faster and look cleaner.

</br>

## Main Idea:

Make a store webpage that has cart and currency changing ability

## Application functional details:

- You can navigate through diffrent categories
- You can open item's detailed view
- You can change currency on website
- You can add items to cart
- You increase item amount in cart
- You decrease item amount in cart

</br>

## What can be done next:

- On item page, when item is added to cart then remove attribute selection together with add to cart button and say to client that it is already in cart
- Flexible design

</br>

## How to boot the application:

- For backend, with CMD you have to move to backend folder, then you need to first npm install. After modules installed you can type yarn build and after that type yarn start for backend to boot on localhost:4000.
- For frontend, with CMD you have to move to webshop folder use npm install to install modules and type npm start for frontend to boot on localhost:3000.
